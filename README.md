# ReVoltAutoSplitter
#What's this?
It's an autosplitter, which generalizes splits, making it even and fair to everyone. It also has a load remover to also prevent people with better hardware to save extra time from loads.
How does this work?
It accesses memory addresses which contain useful information, such as the lap counter, race time and others. Set conditions are written in script for LiveSplit to know what to do at an exact moment.
What does it do?
All Cups:  It starts the timer and it splits at the end of every race. 
Stunt Arena: It starts the timer when the map has loaded in and stops when you get the final star
In which categories does this work?
It works in All Cups (both NG and NG+) and Stunt Arena. 100% is in the works but we lack information and we also have to agree whether how we should track it due to different strategies.
What will this help?
It will help to standardize splits and to have a competition that is accurate and not defected by any matter.
Would any rule be changed?
The rule which allows the user to skip the ceremony by force closing is really considered to be taken out because of the same reasons this autosplitter exists.
Also turning off instances might be removed, but the autosplitter has no relevation in this decision. It saves some time, but it breaks the game's looks.
What would happen to the older runs?
They would be retimed in the case of load removal, but individual splits for the races might not be implemented for those runs.
So are we going to use game time from now on to track the runs?
Probably. Before we go on to use it we should agree on this though.
When is it going to be out?
It can be downloaded here, but I don't know yet if I would put it out globally to LiveSplit's autosplitter database before 100% is also done.
How do I use it?
You first download the .asl file, go to livesplit and right click on the splits, go to edit layout. Add a new object called Scriptable auto splitter and make the script path point to the downloaded file. From there, you can select in advanced options which run are you doing. Select the desired option (for NG+ select both All Cups and NG+) and you're good to go.
